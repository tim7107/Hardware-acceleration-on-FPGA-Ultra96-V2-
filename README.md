# How to deploy a custom deep learning model on FPGA Ultra96-V2 PYNQ
This repo describes the process of using hardware acceleration to accelerate your custom deep learning model on FPGA Ultra96-V2 PYNQ.
Due to the lack of PYNQ tutorials in Taiwan, we here record our experiance of deploying custom deep learning model on Ultra96-V2 PYNQ environment.  
The details please refer to my links: https://knotty-bubbler-b75.notion.site/How-to-deploy-AI-model-on-Ultra96-V2-PYNQ-818b08dded5f432ab9385f358526aef1
