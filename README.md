# Hardware-acceleration-on-FPGA-Ultra96-V2-
This repo describes the process of using hardware acceleration to accelerate your custom deep learning model on FPGA Ultra96-V2 PYNQ.
Due to the lack of PYNQ tutorials in Taiwan, we here record our experiance of deploying custom deep learning model on Ultra96-V2 PYNQ environment.
